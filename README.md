## notes
this project is built with:

React Hooks
Redux Toolkit
React Router
Styled-components
Axios
React-pagination

All categories are working except for "Necklaces" (more about this in the next section), due to the failing endpoint I use this category as a "handling errors example",
for loading I use Skeletons as main technique.
using routing for categories
favorite items are also stored in localStorage

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.
